# Hi, I'm James!
This is intended to be a relatively quick introduction to me, how I work, how I prefer to collaborate, and how I can often be best utilized in a work environment.

# My Past Roles
I've worked and contributed across several different teams with similar responsibilities in each team

I don't manage anyone, I'm not a team lead or subject-matter-expert (SME), but what I _am_ and what I _do_ can be helpful to know.  I tend to think of myself as a force-multiplier and a blocker-breaker.  I tend to want to organize and quantify exactly what's happening in order to make the most impact and progress on a given set of issues or problems.  I pay attention to a _lot_ of information streams, including Slack, emails, and in-person conversations.  I tend to think of the work that I do in the context of how it helps my team or other teams (whether consuming or supporting the services and applications I help provide) do their jobs better and with more certainty.
