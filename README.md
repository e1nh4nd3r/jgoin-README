# Hi, I'm James!
This is intended to be a relatively quick introduction to me, how I work, how I prefer to collaborate, and how I can often be best utilized in a work environment.

# A little about me
* I tend to focus in extreme detail if it's something that is important to me or the team/project.
* I can be easily distracted (and [context-switching is expensive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timfrancis/2017/06/12/the-real-cost-of-context-switching/#7501fe852623)), so I often look for ways to minimize distractions (including working from home, finding "alternative" spaces within a given office space, setting "do not disturb" periods on my calendar, etc).
* I can pay attention to many information streams simultaneously, but often at the cost of being unable to perform complicated tasks.
* I communicate extremely well, but I often prefer to reference documentation wherever possible.

# How I like to work
* I like tasks and projects that are clear, concise, and that have a clear [Definition Of Done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done).
* I tend to work more effectively in spaces that are fairly quiet, don't have a lot of visual distractions (flashing lights, other screens, people walking around in my sight-lines, etc.), and where amenities (like drinks, snacks, and bathrooms) are a short distance away.
* I like being able to communicate changes, releases, and documentation through some form of centralized mechanism such as a team Slack channel, Confluence documentation, or Live Demos during a stand-up meeting.
* I prefer short meetings for stand-up (ideally less than 20 minutes), topic- or task-specific meetings with other team members where some amount of detail or focus is required, and if I don't explicitly _need_ to be in a meeting I prefer to just get an email about it with a summary afterward.

# How I prefer to communicate
* If it's non-critical, emails are great.
* If it's something really quick that doesn't need to be codified anywhere (like a Confluence document or something), Slack tends to work well.
* If discussing something is going to be complicated or detailed, a one-time meeting (with a summary afterward) is great.
* If it's an emergency, Slack works really well (but then again if it's an emergency, referencing documentation around [How To Get Help and What Is An Emergency](http://opsreportcard.com/section/2) would probably be better).

# What I prefer to avoid
* Repetitive tasks
  * Automation, remediation, or fixing bugs should ideally [eliminate toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/)
* Escalations and emergencies
  * These should ideally _**NEVER**_ happen (monitoring, metrics, and alerting should notify us before this response becomes necessary)
  * If they happen, they should _**ALWAYS**_ have a post-mortem and action items to resolve (aka "CAPAs" or "Corrective Actions/Preventative Actions")
* Ambiguity
  * If there isn't a [Definition Of Done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done), finding that is imperative.
  * If there's no overall direction, visible Milestones, or articulated Vision of the product or service, then that's a big problem.
* Over- or under-communication
  * Constant emails, meetings, and Slack notifications are just as bad as radio silence.  Finding the right balance and notification mechanisms is key.
